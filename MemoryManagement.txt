This articles about the composition of Java Memory Model (JMM)
    1.Heap Memory:
        ->Young Generation: 
            This space is for newly created objects. 
            It is subdivided into Eden space, where objects are initially allocated, 
            and two survivor spaces (S0 and S1) for minor garbage collection processes. 
            Most objects die young, hence frequent garbage collection occurs here.
        ->Old Generation:
            Objects that survive multiple garbage collection cycles in the young generation are promoted to the old generation.
             This area is subject to major garbage collections and requires efficient management to optimize performance.
        ->Permanent Generation:
             the Permanent Generation (PermGen) is a part of the heap that was used to store metadata about the classes and methods used in the application. 
             This includes:
                ->Class Metadata: Information about the classes loaded by the JVM.
                ->Method Metadata: Information about the methods of the classes.
                ->Interned Strings: Strings that are interned using the String.intern() method.
                ->Static Variables: Static variables of the classes.

    2. Stack Memory:The stack stores local variables and method call information
