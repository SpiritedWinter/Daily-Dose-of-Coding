class is like logical construct-> defines the skeletal of the object you want to create
for example Human is a class and-> jassi is object/ instance of that Human class

object: physical reality  which actually occupies space in the memory , 
while the classes are only the rule of how the data structure will be 

when you wwrite a new ClassName();
the new keyword dynamically allocates the memory and return the reference to it to the variable stored in stack
