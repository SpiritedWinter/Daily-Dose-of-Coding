Notes on  Coding 

for example I have created an object

x= new List<int>();
then List<int>(); has created its memory in a heap and x is just a reference variable
1. reference variables are stored in the stack memory and objects are stored in heap
2. for example if
    int a=10; //10 is an int object in a heap a
    a = 20;// 10 object goes for garbage collection nad a points to object 20
